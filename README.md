## Supported features

+ Images
+ Suggestion Chips (Quick Replies)
+ Payloads (Platform-specific responses)

This library is intended to help build Node.js Dialogflow Fulfillment for multiple [integrations](https://dialogflow.com/docs/integrations/) including Google Assistant, Slack, Facebook, Telegram, Kik, Skype, Line, and Viber. See the reference documentation for more: https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/fulfillment-library/webhook-client

If only building Dialogflow Fulfillment for the [Google Assistant](https://dialogflow.com/docs/integrations/google-assistant) and no other integrations, use the Actions of Google NPM module ([actions-on-google](https://www.npmjs.com/package/actions-on-google)) which supports all Actions on Google features.

## Quick Start
1. [Sign-up/Log-in to Dialogflow](https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/#/login)
2. Create a Dialogflow agent
3. Go to **Settings** > **Export and Import** > **Import from Zip**
4. Then type `"IMPORT"` and thatÂ´s it.

## Setup Instructions
```javascript
// Import the appropriate class
const { WebhookClient } = require('dialogflow-fulfillment');

 //Create an instance
const agent = new WebhookClient({request: request, response: response});
```
